# react-redux-webpack-starter

This is my starter app for React, Redux, and Webpack. It includes redux-thunk and middleware for making API calls to an AJAX store.

This also makes use of webpack 2.1, which is in beta at the moment.

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install packages. `npm run server` starts webpack-dev-server.
